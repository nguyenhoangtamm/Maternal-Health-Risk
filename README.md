# Maternal Health Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict maternal health risks using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify potential health issues in pregnant women to provide timely medical interventions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various health indicators of pregnant women, including:
- Age
- Systolic Blood Pressure (SystolicBP)
- Diastolic Blood Pressure (DiastolicBP)
- Blood Sugar Levels (BS)
- Body Temperature (BodyTemp)
- Heart Rate
- Risk Level
